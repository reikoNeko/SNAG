## SECURITY IS NOT A GAME (THE GAME)
### from Tron to DefCon in 45 minutes

### Let's say it started with TRON

<img src="images/discs_of_tron_cabinet.png" height="400" align="right" alt="Discs of Tron video game cabinet">

In the movie and the game, Flynn encodes a disk with the data he needs to bypass the Master Control Program and has to find a way to exfiltrate it.

We never get to see how he encodes the data or breaks the MCP with code. He just throws a frisbee a lot.

### Push Button, Get Hack

This abstraction continued through thirty years of cyberpunk games from Neuromancer (1988) through the Deus Ex series including the latest release, Mankind Divided.

### Moar Please

* More recently, hacking games like Hacknet, Hack'n'Slash, Else Heart.Break(), and Exapunks, have focused on actually chaging code within the game
---
#### Hack'n'Slash
* Zelda-like adventure where your sword is a USB device.
* Anything with a port can be tweaked.
* Adjust variables to change object behaviors.

<img src="images/hack_n_slash_turtle_spawner.jpg" height="300" align="center" alt="Flipped turtles can be programmed.">

---
#### Hacknet
* Story-driven through email, simplified penetration testing
* Lots of easter eggs like #TalesFromIRC
* Uses some actual Linux/DOS commands (ls|dir, man, scp)  and scripts like SSHcrack

<img src="images/hacknet.png" height="300" align="center" alt="Read others' IRC chats">


---
#### Else Heart.Break()
* Acquire a Modifier and change the code of street lights, network junctions, even beer!
* In-game language called Spr√•k has developed a small community on github.
* Story progression is weak but the programming options are not.

---
#### Zachtronics games
* Three different programming games that use assembly: TIS-100, Shenzhen I/O, and EXAPUNKS
* In Steam versions, your solutions are ranked against other players'.
---
#### Exapunks
* You're sick with "the Phage." Hack or die.
* Read Zines to get gnarly coding tips.
* Solve problems by programming robotic agents that have IPC.
* Swarm your bots and then terminate them. Take all data, leave no trace.

---
### Capture the Flag Games
* Find flags, score points.
* Use system administration and penetration testing skills.
* There's some programming but this isn't Project Euler
* Many have prizes.

---
#### One team, two team, red team, blue team
* The Red Team attacks systems. Many CTFs are only about exercising Red Team skills.
* The Blue Team defends systems. Most system administration jobs are only about exercising Blue Team skills.
* CTF puzzles help defenders think like attackers.

---
#### CTFs use multiple skillsets
* Command line tools 
* Web scraping
* Steganography
* Exploiting CVEs

---
#### Ybj unatvat sehvg
Introductory puzzles whet the palette for harder challenges.
* Find plain text flags in zip files, html, robots.txt
* Simple encodings like rot13 or base64 often found
```
    In [7]: import codecs
    In [8]: codecs.decode('Ybj unatvat sehvg', 'rot_13')
    Out[8]: 'Low hanging fruit'
```
* Have perl, ipython or Jupyter notebooks handy!
* Handy practice for solving small real-life problems!

#### Last night a <strike>DJ</strike> hacker saved my life.
Problem: WPRB's stream no longer worked in Rhythmbox

Solution: View the source of their pop-up player
```
P3jPLAYLISTS.inline_0 = [
    { name: "listen", 
      formats: ["mp3"], 
      mp3: "aHR0cDovL3dwcmIuc3RyZWFtZ3V5czEuY29tL2xpc3Rlbi5tcDM=", 
      ....  }
  ];
```  

Use 1337 CTF skills to get the new URL

```
$ echo "aHR0cDovL3dwcmIuc3RyZWFtZ3V5czEuY29tL2xpc3Rlbi5tcDM=" | base64 -d
http://wprb.streamguys1.com/listen.mp3
```

---
#### You should know better by now
Other common mid-tier CTF puzzles exploit well-known problems
* Weak encryption schemes
* SQL injection and Cross-site scripting
* Default passwords

If these seem contrived, think about IoT devices, or companies still running Windows XP and Server 2008, RHEL 5, or Debian Wheezy. Have you been to https://www.shodan.io?

---
#### A picture is worth...
* Look for flags or URLs in EXIF data
* Eye of Gnome|Mate, GwenView, Python PILlow library and others show image metadata
* steghide or stegosuite may have been used on the image itself
* Open GIF animations in gimp to adjust palettes.

---
### Online CTFs
* Great place to build skills
* Some have internal chat systems or comunity boards
* Play anywhere any time
* Usually stay available after the scoring period ends

---
#### Microcorruption
* More programming than system adminstration
* Binary disassembly challenge!
* Watch what happens when you overflow a buffer.

---
#### OWASP Juice Shop
* Deliberately subjectable to web attacks
* Based on Open Web Application Security Project top 10 vulnerabilities
* Source available on Github
* Attack by hand or use it to learn Kali|Parrot|ArchStrike

https://juice-shop.herokuapp.com

---
#### SANS Holiday Hack
* Sponsored by SANS Institute (who also do expensive training and live CTFs)
* Annual Xmas-themed competition dating back to 2015
* Have problems that use recent or famous bugs
* Watch blogs at sans.org and major CVEs to get a head start
* Reports are a major requirement
* Prizes like t-shirts, challenge coins, admission to online classes
https://holidayhackchallenge.com

#### More online stuff
* Smash the Stack: http://smashthestack.org
* Google CTF: https://capturetheflag.withgoogle.com


---
### Try this at home
After getting your feet wet online, you can download virtual machines to test at home.
* DO NOT expose these to your outside network.
* Great way to set up packet capturing|filtering to see what attacks look like
* Attack, defend, attack again, wipe and reinstall
* Require VirtualBox, KVM, or VMWare Player

---
#### Damn Vulnerable Linux
* One of the first deliberately insecure releases
* Discontinued ten years ago and based on slackware, for true horror fans.

---
#### Metasploitable
* Testbed for the Metasploit framework
* Free resources from the folks who make Kali

https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/requirements/

---
#### OWASP BWA
* Broken Web Appications, the precursor to Juice Shop
* Still available as a VM

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Broken_Web_Applications_Project

---
#### VulnHub
* Many, MANY more deliberately insecure virtual machines

https://www.vulnhub.com

---
### Come up to the lab
* Old hardware is great! 
* Don't throw away that insecure D-Link router, use it to make a quarantined network!
* I have a cheap $200 laptop just for running Kali.

Dumpster diving ain't what it used to be, but there are always Raspberry Pis

---
#### RasPwn
* Virtual network of insecure machines running on a single Pi.
* Supports RPi 2 or 3B (not 3B+ or 3A+)
